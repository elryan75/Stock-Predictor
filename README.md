# Stock Market Forecasting
### McGill ML Bootcamp final project

##The Project
The goal of my project was to forecast the shot-term growth of a stock using machine learning. I made a WebApp in which you can enter the ticker of any stock and get its forecasted growth.
My webapp automically retrieves the latest data about the stock using an API. It then calculates technical indicators about the stock such as momentum and feeds it to my model. I experimented with many variables and kept the best predictive variables. I chose an LSTM model to try to detect within the data I fed and did some time series analysis.

##Run the Web App
1. Download the /WebApp/ folder
2. Run the app.py file
3. Access the Webapp in localhost:4996 in the browser of your choice.
